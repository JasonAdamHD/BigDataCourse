        "Collaborative filtering is often used for recommendations including book recommendations (e.g. on Amazon), movie recommendations (e.g. Netflix), general product recommendation (e.g. if you buy skis and bindings, maybe you should buy poles too), and other kinds of recommendations.

        "> Virtually every student has had an online experience where a website makes personalized recommendations in hopes of future sales or ongoing traffic. Amazon.com tells you \"Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought\", YouTube makes suggestions for other videos to watch, and NetFlix ran a contest with a million dollar prize for an algorithm that would improve their movie recommendations. In this assignment, students write a program that makes personalized book recommendations using algorithms with increasing levels of sophistication.\n",
        "\n",
        ">After reading a pre-collected set of ratings for a list of books, the program makes recommendations for a particular reader based on a small set of sample ratings from that reader and the preferences of other readers in the community. The assignment was inspired by machine learning research used to predict book preferences for Chapters.Indigo.ca. It provides the opportunity to discuss similarity measures for non-trivial objects and alludes to machine learning techniques.\n",

Another way to make data collection more general would be to survey the users age and show them books similar in genre and age of the reader so that they are shown books that they have likely read. Showing books that the user has likely read, in a large survey such as our example in lab, will likely increases the overall non-zero ratings that a user gives meaning that we can more accurately predict which users are similar to other users. If you were running a book store, every time one customer was about to purchase a new book, you could ask the customer their rating on the previous book that they had purchased and possibly reward them in some way for that rating. This would likely lead to an increase in ratings because more people being asked more frequently about their ratings on a book would add to the dataset."
